# Specification Quality Checklist: Contiguous Availability Blocks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED âœ“

**Review Notes**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-centric language without technical implementation details. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   - Success criteria include both quantitative (time, percentage) and qualitative (user understanding, decision-making) measures
   - All success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific APIs, frameworks, or technologies)
   - Edge cases comprehensively cover boundary conditions
   - Scope is clearly bounded: extends existing availability finder with mode selection
   - Assumptions section documents all reasonable defaults

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Three prioritized user stories cover the complete user journey
   - Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
   - Success criteria map to measurable user and business outcomes
   - Specification maintains clear separation from implementation concerns

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
