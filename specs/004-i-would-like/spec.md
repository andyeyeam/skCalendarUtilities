# Feature Specification: Calendar Event Display on Find Availability Screen

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-would-like`
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I would like to be able to see my calendar for the selected days on the Find Availability screen presented so that it is easy to read. So that I can not only selected when I am available but I can see what calendar events exist on those days"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Scheduled Events While Finding Availability (Priority: P1)

Users want to see their existing calendar events for the date range they're searching so they can understand the context of their availability. When looking at available time slots, users need to know what meetings or events are scheduled to make better decisions about which slots to select.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature - helping users understand their schedule context while selecting availability. Without this, users would need to check their calendar separately.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a date range, clicking "Find Availability", and verifying that both (a) available slots are shown and (b) existing calendar events are displayed for the same date range. Delivers immediate value by providing schedule visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have entered a date range (e.g., Jan 15-19, 9AM-5PM), **When** I click "Find Availability", **Then** the results show both my available time slots and my scheduled calendar events for those dates
2. **Given** the availability results are displayed, **When** I view a specific date (e.g., Jan 16), **Then** I can see all calendar events scheduled for that day alongside the available slots
3. **Given** I have multiple events on a single day, **When** I view that day's calendar, **Then** all events are displayed in chronological order with their times and titles
4. **Given** I have no events on a particular day in the search range, **When** I view that day, **Then** I see an indication that the day has no scheduled events (e.g., "No events scheduled")

### User Story 2 - Distinguish Between Available and Busy Times (Priority: P2)

Users need a clear visual distinction between available time slots and busy times (calendar events) so they can quickly scan their schedule and make selection decisions.

**Why this priority**: Visual clarity improves usability but the feature provides value even without sophisticated styling. Users can still see the information in P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing any day with both events and availability, and verifying that events are visually distinct from available slots (through styling, color, icons, or layout).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a day has both available slots and scheduled events, **When** I view that day, **Then** available slots and calendar events are visually distinguishable (different styling, sections, or colors)
2. **Given** I am scanning multiple days, **When** I quickly look at the schedule, **Then** I can immediately identify which blocks are available versus busy
3. **Given** an event conflicts with what would be available time, **When** I view that time period, **Then** the busy time is clearly marked and not shown as available

### User Story 3 - See Event Details for Better Context (Priority: P3)

Users want to see key details about each calendar event (title, time, duration) so they understand what commitments they have when selecting availability.

**Why this priority**: Event details enhance decision-making but the basic visibility (P1) already provides value. Details help users remember what meetings they have scheduled.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating calendar events with specific titles and viewing them in the Find Availability screen to verify the details are displayed accurately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a calendar event titled "Team Standup", **When** I view that day's calendar, **Then** I see "Team Standup" displayed with the event
2. **Given** an event has a specific start time (e.g., 10:00 AM) and duration (e.g., 30 min), **When** I view the event, **Then** the time and duration are displayed (e.g., "10:00 AM - 10:30 AM" or "10:00 AM (30 min)")
3. **Given** I have events with long titles, **When** I view the calendar, **Then** titles are displayed in a readable format (truncated if needed, with full text accessible)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a calendar event spans multiple days (e.g., all-day events, multi-day conferences)?
- What happens when the user has many events on a single day (10+ meetings)?
- How does the display handle very long event titles (50+ characters)?
- What happens when an event extends beyond the search time range (e.g., search is 9AM-5PM but event is 4PM-6PM)?
- How are recurring events displayed if the search spans multiple occurrences?
- What happens if the calendar API fails to fetch events but availability search succeeds?
- How are all-day events displayed alongside timed events?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch calendar events for the selected date range when the "Find Availability" search is performed
- **FR-002**: System MUST display calendar events alongside available time slots in the results section
- **FR-003**: System MUST show event details including event title, start time, end time, and duration
- **FR-004**: System MUST display events in chronological order within each day
- **FR-005**: System MUST indicate when a day has no scheduled events
- **FR-006**: System MUST visually distinguish calendar events from available time slots
- **FR-007**: System MUST display complete calendar events including their full time range, even when events extend beyond the searched time range boundaries (e.g., if search is 9AM-5PM and event is 4PM-6PM, show the event as "4:00 PM - 6:00 PM")
- **FR-008**: System MUST group calendar events by date, matching the grouping of available slots
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle errors gracefully if calendar events cannot be fetched (e.g., show availability results but indicate events couldn't be loaded)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Calendar Event**: Represents a scheduled item on the user's calendar
  - Key attributes: title, start time, end time, duration, date
  - Relationship: Events belong to the same calendar being searched for availability
  - Note: Events represent "busy" time as opposed to "available" time slots

- **Available Time Slot** (existing): Represents free time on the calendar
  - Enhanced context: Now displayed alongside calendar events to show the complete schedule picture
  - Relationship: Available slots are time periods when no calendar events are scheduled

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view both available slots and calendar events for a selected date range within the same results view
- **SC-002**: Calendar events display with complete information (title, time, duration) within 2 seconds of the availability search completing
- **SC-003**: Users can distinguish between available time slots and calendar events at a glance (within 1 second of viewing a date)
- **SC-004**: The calendar display remains readable and usable when viewing up to 10 events per day
- **SC-005**: Event display errors do not prevent users from viewing and selecting available time slots (graceful degradation)

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- Calendar events will be fetched from the same Google Calendar that is being searched for availability
- Events shown will respect the same time boundaries as the availability search (start date/time to end date/time)
- All-day events will be displayed separately or at the top/bottom of daily schedules
- Users have sufficient permissions to view calendar event details from their own calendar
- The existing Google Calendar API (CalendarApp) provides access to event details needed
- Event fetching will not significantly slow down the availability search (both can be retrieved in the same server call or in parallel)
- Private/confidential event details (if any) will follow standard calendar privacy rules

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

- Editing or modifying calendar events from the Find Availability screen
- Creating new calendar events directly from this screen
- Filtering events by category, color, or other attributes
- Showing event attendees or location details
- Displaying event descriptions or notes
- Integration with calendars other than the primary Google Calendar being searched
- Real-time synchronization if calendar events change while viewing the screen
- Exporting or copying calendar events to clipboard (only available slots are copyable)
