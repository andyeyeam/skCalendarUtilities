## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: Which bulk operations should be supported? → A: Delete, color/category change, and move to calendar
- Q: How should the application handle Calendar API rate limiting during bulk operations? → A: Queue operations with progress indicator
- Q: Should the application support multiple calendars? → A: Single calendar with selector (user picks one calendar to work with per session)
- Q: What format should analytics data be presented in? → A: Simple tables with summary statistics
- Q: What criteria should determine duplicate events? → A: Title and start time match

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Utility Menu (Priority: P1)

Users need a clear, easy-to-navigate menu to discover and access available calendar utilities from within a Google Sites page. The menu acts as the primary entry point for all calendar management functions.

**Why this priority**: Without a functional menu, users cannot access any utilities. This is the foundation that enables all other features and represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by embedding the application in a Google Sites page, verifying the menu appears with labeled options, and confirming each menu item is clickable and identifiable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is embedded in a Google Sites page, **When** the user loads the page, **Then** a menu displaying available utility options appears with clear labels
2. **Given** the menu is displayed, **When** the user views the menu, **Then** each utility option is clearly described and visually distinguishable
3. **Given** the menu is displayed, **When** the user clicks a utility option, **Then** the utility interface replaces the menu and takes over the entire application display area
4. **Given** a utility is displayed, **When** the user views the utility interface, **Then** a clearly visible back/home button is available to return to the main menu

### User Story 2 - Bulk Event Operations (Priority: P2)

Users need to perform operations on multiple calendar events simultaneously to save time when managing recurring patterns, cleaning up old events, or making systematic changes.

**Why this priority**: Bulk operations address a major pain point in standard calendar interfaces where users must edit events one by one. This delivers significant time savings for users managing busy calendars.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating multiple test events, using the bulk operation utility to modify them (e.g., change color category, delete events matching criteria), and verifying all targeted events are updated correctly while non-targeted events remain unchanged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has selected the bulk operations utility, **When** they specify selection criteria (date range, keyword, category), **Then** the system displays all matching events for review before taking action
2. **Given** matching events are displayed, **When** the user confirms the bulk operation, **Then** all selected events are updated and the user receives a summary of changes made
3. **Given** the user specifies invalid criteria, **When** they attempt to execute a bulk operation, **Then** the system displays a helpful error message explaining the issue

### User Story 3 - Event Analytics and Insights (Priority: P3)

Users want to understand how they spend their time by viewing analytics about their calendar events, including time distribution across categories, meeting patterns, and scheduling trends.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide valuable insights but are not essential for day-to-day calendar management. This enhances the user experience after core utility functions are established.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by populating a calendar with diverse events over a specific time period, running the analytics utility, and verifying that metrics (total hours by category, busiest days, most frequent event types) are accurately calculated and clearly presented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user selects the analytics utility, **When** they specify a date range, **Then** the system displays visual summaries of time allocation, meeting frequency, and scheduling patterns
2. **Given** analytics are displayed, **When** the user views the results, **Then** data is presented in an easy-to-understand format with clear labels and meaningful metrics
3. **Given** the user has no events in the selected date range, **When** they run analytics, **Then** the system displays a friendly message indicating no data is available for the selected period

---

### User Story 4 - Calendar Cleanup and Maintenance (Priority: P4)

Users need tools to identify and remove outdated events, duplicates, or events matching specific cleanup criteria to maintain an organized calendar over time.

**Why this priority**: Cleanup utilities are valuable for long-term calendar hygiene but not immediately essential. Users can operate effectively without this feature initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating a calendar with duplicate events, old placeholder entries, and canceled events, then using the cleanup utility to identify and optionally remove them, verifying that only appropriate events are flagged or deleted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user selects the cleanup utility, **When** they run a duplicate detection scan, **Then** the system identifies events with matching titles and times and presents them for review
2. **Given** potential cleanup candidates are identified, **When** the user reviews the list, **Then** they can selectively choose which events to delete or keep
3. **Given** the user confirms deletions, **When** cleanup executes, **Then** selected events are permanently removed and a confirmation summary is displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user has no calendar events in their calendar?
  - Display a friendly message indicating the calendar is empty and utilities requiring events will have no data to process
- What happens when calendar API access is denied or revoked?
  - Display a clear error message requesting the user to re-authorize the application with appropriate permissions
- What happens when the user attempts an operation on a calendar they don't have edit permissions for?
  - Prevent the operation and display an error explaining they need edit permissions for the target calendar
- What happens when the application is embedded in a very narrow iframe on Google Sites?
  - Menu and interface elements adapt to narrow widths, potentially using a compact/hamburger menu style
- What happens when the user performs a bulk operation that would affect hundreds of events?
  - Display a confirmation dialog showing the number of events that will be affected and require explicit user confirmation
- What happens during first run when no configuration data exists?
  - Automatically create the required Google Sheet for data persistence and initialize with default settings

## Assumptions

- Users have Google Workspace accounts with access to Google Calendar
- Users have appropriate permissions to embed custom applications in Google Sites
- Users' Google Calendar contains standard event data (title, date/time, description)
- The application will primarily be used on desktop browsers, with mobile support as a secondary consideration
- Users are comfortable granting Google Calendar API permissions to the application
- Standard calendar utilities include bulk operations, analytics, and cleanup functions (common industry patterns)
- Menu interaction follows standard web UI patterns (click to select, inline or modal display)
- Google Apps Script quota limits (daily API calls, execution time) are sufficient for typical usage patterns
- Users will interact with utilities infrequently (not continuously refreshing or running operations)
