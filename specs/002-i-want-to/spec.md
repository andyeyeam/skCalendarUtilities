# Feature Specification: Availability Finder

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-01-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to be able to add a new button that when pressed will identify my availability between two specified date and times where there is an assumed working day of 09:00 to 17:30"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Find Available Time Slots (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

As a calendar user, I want to quickly find all my available time slots within a date range so I can schedule new meetings or understand when I'm free.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - finding free time is the primary reason users would use this feature. Without this, the feature provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a date range, clicking "Find Availability", and verifying that the system correctly identifies and displays all free time slots between 09:00-17:30 on each working day.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a calendar with some booked events, **When** I specify a start date and end date and click "Find Availability", **Then** the system displays all available time slots during working hours (09:00-17:30) excluding weekends
2. **Given** I have a completely free day, **When** I search for availability on that date, **Then** the system shows one continuous slot from 09:00 to 17:30
3. **Given** I have a meeting from 10:00-11:00, **When** I search for availability on that day, **Then** the system shows two slots: 09:00-10:00 and 11:00-17:30
4. **Given** I specify a date range spanning multiple days, **When** I click "Find Availability", **Then** the system shows available slots grouped by date

### User Story 2 - Filter Availability by Duration (Priority: P2)

As a calendar user, I want to filter available slots by minimum duration so I only see slots long enough for my intended meeting.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usefulness by eliminating slots too short to be practical. Common use case: "I need 1 hour for a meeting, don't show me 15-minute gaps."

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by specifying a minimum duration (e.g., 60 minutes) and verifying only slots of that length or longer are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have availability slots of varying lengths (30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours), **When** I set minimum duration to 1 hour, **Then** only slots of 1 hour or longer are shown
2. **Given** I have only short gaps between meetings, **When** I set minimum duration to 2 hours, **Then** the system shows "No availability found" message
3. **Given** I haven't specified a minimum duration, **When** I search, **Then** all available slots are shown regardless of length

### User Story 3 - Export Availability Results (Priority: P3)

As a calendar user, I want to export my availability results so I can share them with colleagues or save for reference.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have convenience feature. Users can manually copy information if needed, so this is less critical.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running an availability search and verifying the export produces a readable format (text/table) with all slots listed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have availability results displayed, **When** I click "Export", **Then** the system generates a text summary I can copy
2. **Given** I have no availability, **When** I try to export, **Then** the system shows an appropriate message
3. **Given** availability spans multiple days, **When** I export, **Then** the output is organized by date with clear formatting

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the date range spans only weekends (no working days)? â†’ System displays error message "No working days in selected range"
- What happens when the start date is after the end date?
- What happens when every slot in the working day is booked?
- What happens when an event starts before 09:00 but extends into working hours?
- What happens when an event starts during working hours but extends past 17:30?
- What happens when an all-day event is present?
- What happens when the user selects a date range more than 7 days?
- What happens when events overlap in the calendar?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-004**: System MUST exclude weekends (Saturday and Sunday) from availability search by default
- **FR-005**: System MUST retrieve all calendar events within the specified date range
- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate free time slots by subtracting booked events from working hours

- **FR-009**: System MUST handle the case where no availability exists within the date range
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that start date is not after end date

- **FR-012**: System MUST handle events that start before or extend beyond working hours by clipping them to the 09:00-17:30 window
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a way to return to the main menu from the availability finder
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle all-day events by treating them as blocking the entire working day (09:00-17:30)
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle overlapping events by treating the time as unavailable if any event occupies it
- **FR-016**: System MUST limit date range searches to a maximum of 7 days and display an error message if exceeded
- **FR-017**: System MUST display time slots with 15-minute granularity (e.g., 09:00, 09:15, 09:30)
- **FR-018**: System MUST exclude availability slots shorter than 15 minutes from results
- **FR-019**: System MUST display times in 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators
- **FR-020**: System MUST display error message "No working days in selected range" when date range contains only weekends

### Key Entities

- **TimeSlot**: Represents a period of free time with start time, end time, duration, and date
- **WorkingHours**: Represents the defined working day boundaries (09:00 start, 17:30 end)
- **AvailabilitySearch**: Represents a user's search request with start date, end date, and optional minimum duration filter
- **CalendarEvent**: Existing entity from calendar - represents booked time that reduces availability

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can find all available time slots within a 7-day range in under 5 seconds
- **SC-002**: System correctly identifies availability with 100% accuracy when tested against known calendar states
- **SC-003**: Users can specify date ranges and receive results within 3 clicks from the main menu
- **SC-004**: System handles edge cases (all-day events, overlapping events, weekend days) without errors
- **SC-005**: 90% of users can understand and interpret the availability results without additional help
- **SC-006**: Feature reduces time spent manually checking calendar availability by at least 60%

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-11

- Q: What is the minimum time slot granularity for displaying availability? â†’ A: 15 minutes
- Q: Should the system display availability slots shorter than 15 minutes? â†’ A: Hide slots < 15 minutes - Only show slots of 15 minutes or longer
- Q: Should time slots be displayed in 12-hour or 24-hour format? â†’ A: 12-hour with AM/PM (e.g., "9:00 AM - 10:30 AM")
- Q: What should happen when a user selects a date range that contains only weekend days? â†’ A: Show error message - "No working days in range"
- Q: Within each day, how should multiple availability slots be sorted? â†’ A: Earliest first - chronological order (9:00 AM before 2:00 PM)
